Dapp interaction
-------
The web3 provider injected by the Gnosis Safe Authenticator has been separated in a different github repository ([SafeWeb3Provider](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-web3-provider)) and is imported and injected by this extension.

Dapps must be **whitelisted** in order to have full access to the provider.

It is highly recommended to integrate it in your Dapp to asure a good performance.

**Different situations:**

- **Only the Gnosis Safe Authenticator is installed**
	- **Dapp is not whitelisted**
		- *Dapp integrates safe-web3-provider*
			- Dapp is unusable. Local safe-web3-provider is empty (no Safe account data and pop-up never opens).
		- *Dapp is not integrated with the Safe*
			- Dapp is unusable.
	- **Dapp is whitelisted**
		- *Dapp integrates safe-web3-provider*
			- safe-web3-provider is injected by default. Local safe-web3-provider can be used if selected.
		- *Dapp is not integrated with the Safe*
			- safe-web3-provider is injected by default. Be careful if Dapp listens to the provider at load event. There is no problem with Dapps that load the provider using a button.
	
- **Both Gnosis Safe Authenticator and Metamask are installed**
	- **Dapp is not whitelisted**
		- *Metamask is used*
	- **Dapp is whitelisted**
		- *Dapp integrates safe-web3-provider*
			- Local safe-web3-provider is used.
		- *Dapp is not integrated with the Safe*
			- Metamask is used.
